<h1>The Best Ever Books According to Anastasia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite books</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Chronicles of Narnia</h3>
<p>I guess I read this book at least 10 times — no exaggeration. The story is full of referrences to the Bible and ancient myths, and the older you get the more you notice these little details, these analogies. The book get to you on many different levels, not matter how old you are.</p>
<h3>The Moominpapa and The Sea</h3>
<p>My most cherished childhood stories were about the Moomin family. This one's my favourite — because, you know, the sea, my beloved autumn and the moody setting of a life on a lighthouse. For ever precious one.</p>
<h3>Dandelion Wine</h3>
<p>Any book written by Ray Bradbury is a rare masterpiece, yet this one is, by far, above all, being a coming-of-age story, full of love, pain of growing up and the fragility of young age. Relatable and eternal.</p>
